## Coding Journal

- Continuing on yesterdays problems I kept thinking of ways on how to properly sort my data
- I wasn't able to think of a solution until i read a solution that broke down the problem into smaller parts
- gather the data and sort it

### [**Count the divisors of a number**](https://www.codewars.com/kata/542c0f198e077084c0000c2e/train/javascript)

### [**Code to Solution**](codewars/Count_the_divisors_of_a_number.js)

Level: 7 kyu

Time to complete: ~5 minutes

### thoughts

- I used a for loop to loop through the numbers from 1 to the number passed in as an argument and check if the number is divisible by the number in the loop and if it is I add 1 to the count variable and return the count variable at the end of the function after the loop is done.

## Problem 2

## coding journal

- At The moment I am still working on small business website with a photo gallery and text blog ssg
- The tech I am using is Nextjs, Tailwindcss, and Strapi cms for the backend
- the purpose of the project is to learn how to use strapi cms to create a backend for a website and to learn how to use nextjs to create a static site generator for a blog and photo gallery
- This way I am able to create a website that is easy to update and maintain and I can use it to showcase my work and to learn new things
- By using a cms I am able to create a website that is easy to update and maintain by the client.
- I want the client to be able to update the text content or add new blog posts without having to touch any code.
- no client wants to mess around with any code so a cms is a great way to make it easy for them to update the website.

## Notes

- I am going to be using this as a way to keep track of my progress and to keep me motivated to keep coding.

## What I learned today

- I noticed my commits were not registering as contributions on github
- The issue was with my laptops git config email not matching the email I used to create the github account
- I fixed this by changing the email in the git config file
- I also learned that I can use the command `git config --global --edit` to edit the git config file
- git config --global user.email "email here"

### [**Counting Duplicates**](https://www.codewars.com/kata/54bf1c2cd5b56cc47f0007a1/train/javascript)

### [**Code to Solution**](codewars/Counting_Duplicates.js)

Level: 6 kyu

Time to complete: ~20 minutes

### thoughts

- I've done a challenge like this before for the amazon assesment.
- basically check all the values in the string keep a count of the occurances and then return the count of the values that have a count greater than 1.
- what was hard is trying to remeber how to add to my object and how to check if a key exists in an object. I had to look up the syntax for both of those things.
