## coding journal

- At The moment I am still working on small business website with a photo gallery and text blog ssg
- The tech I am using is Nextjs, Tailwindcss, and Strapi cms for the backend
- the purpose of the project is to learn how to use strapi cms to create a backend for a website and to learn how to use nextjs to create a static site generator for a blog and photo gallery
- This way I am able to create a website that is easy to update and maintain and I can use it to showcase my work and to learn new things
- By using a cms I am able to create a website that is easy to update and maintain by the client.
- I want the client to be able to update the text content or add new blog posts without having to touch any code.
- no client wants to mess around with any code so a cms is a great way to make it easy for them to update the website.

## Notes

- I am going to be using this as a way to keep track of my progress and to keep me motivated to keep coding.

## What I learned today

- I noticed my commits were not registering as contributions on github
- The issue was with my laptops git config email not matching the email I used to create the github account
- I fixed this by changing the email in the git config file
- I also learned that I can use the command `git config --global --edit` to edit the git config file
- git config --global user.email "email here"
