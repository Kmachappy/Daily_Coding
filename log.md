# Daily Coding

# Day 2 - October 11, 2022

# Day 1 - October 10, 2022

## Notes

- I am going to be using this as a way to keep track of my progress and to keep me motivated to keep coding.

## What I learned today

- I noticed my commits were not registering as contributions on github
- The issue was with my laptops git config email not matching the email I used to create the github account
- I fixed this by changing the email in the git config file
- I also learned that I can use the command `git config --global --edit` to edit the git config file
- git config --global user.email "email here"

## Problem 1
